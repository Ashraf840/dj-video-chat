# WebRTC Basics

=>  WebRTC stands for Web RealTime Communication. In WebRTC, there are no intermideiary servers among the platforms.
    The transfer of data is peer-to-peer for communication.


[ in the surface-level brief ]:  A signalling server is responsible for establishing the connection between two clients ( browsers ).


(WebRTC Connection)
----------------------
1st Step:  
    the creation of offers. Simply, assume there are two clients ( client1, client2 ).
    client1 sends an offer called Javascript object (SDP) to the signalling server.
    [ NOTE ]:  SDP stands for Session Description Protocol. It's only contain the information about the media-configuration of the client1.
    Then the signalling-server sends that SDP to the client2 & it'll store the SDP (offer) to it's local memory.
    Once the 'client2' stores the offer of 'client1', it has to create it's answer in response to the offer (SDP) & lately sends that to the "client1" through the signalling-server.

2nd Step:    
    At this stage, the both machines know the media-configuration of each other, but still don't know how to establish connection between them.
    For that, they need to interchange their network configurations using ICE ( Interactive Connectivity Establishment ).
    Whenever the offers (SDPs) are interchanged, the ICE candidates start coming from the WebRTC candidates.
    ICE candiadtes are generated from the STUN & TURN servers & sends along with the SDP offers. 
    Thus the network configurations of the two peers are interchaged along with the SDPs ( offers ).
    Using that network information, those two peers get connected.
